# Coding-1-Final
 my website is about what i like and what i enjoy.
 it is about the school i got to, and the things i like.
 i enjoy playing video games and coding.
 the reason i put those together is because i want o be a game developer.
 so my site does tell about what i like.
 it also shows the school i go to, and i take my coding
 class there.
 my coding class is very fun and informative.
 it makes learning code both fast an easy.
 we learn both html and CSS, the class is fun to learn.
Good bye.
